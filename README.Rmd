Welcome to my github pages repo! My name is Naresh de Bruijn, and I am pleased to introduce you to this Gitbook. This project was built using the CRAN R package {bookdown}, inspired by [Yihui Xie](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/).

Within this Gitbook, you will find a collection of RMarkdown files containing my portfolio assignments. These assignments demonstrate the skills I acquired during the Data Sciences for Biology minor at University of Applied Sciences Utrecht. This Gitbook is linked to a GitHub Pages website, which serves as my final product for the DSFB2 Workflows course.
