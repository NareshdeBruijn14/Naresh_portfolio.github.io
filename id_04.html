<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p class="justify0">
This exercise utilizes a dataset provided by J. Louter (INT/ILC) from an experiment involving adult C. elegans nematodes. The experiment aimed to investigate the effects of different compounds at varying concentrations on the reproductive output of these nematodes. Key variables in the dataset include the number of offspring (RawData), the generic name of the compound (compName), the concentration of the compound (compConcentration), and the type of experiment (expType). This dataset offers valuable insights into the dose-response relationships and the potential toxicological impacts of chemical exposure on C. elegans, serving as a model for broader biological and ecological studies.

<h5>After importing and inspecting the dataset, there were few things notable:</h5>
<ul class="g">
<li>
The data type of ‚ÄúRawdata‚Äù is currently double; it needs to be converted to integer. Additionally, it contains 5 NA values.
</li>
<li>
The data type of compConcentration is currently character, which will cause an error when used on the X-axis. We need to convert it to double.
</li>
<li>
The ‚ÄúcompConcentration‚Äù values are mostly in units of nM, but for the experiments with Ethanol, the units are in percentage (pct). These values need to be converted to nM first.
</li>
<li>
The compName and expType variables are currently stored as character strings. To use them effectively in our plot, we need to convert them into factors.

<h3>Normalising CE_LIQ_FLOW_062_Tidydata</h3>
<p class="justify0">
We are interested in how the number of nematode offspring changes after incubation with a substance compared to the normal situation. This information cannot be discerned from the above graph because the number of offspring in the negative control is not shown. To address this, I normalize the data by expressing the number of offspring in each measurement as a fraction of the average number of offspring after incubation in S-medium.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p class="justify0">
In the positive control group, significantly fewer nematodes were born after incubation in 1.5% ethanol compared to S-medium, as indicated by a fraction much smaller than 1. At substance concentrations below approximately 0.06 nM (see red dashed line or log10 values below -1.25), the number of nematodes born was either similar to, less than, or greater than the number born in the negative control group. Therefore, at these lower concentrations, there appears to be no noticeable effect on the number of offspring. However, at higher concentrations of the three tested substances, fewer nematodes were born compared to the negative control, indicating a significant impact on offspring production.
