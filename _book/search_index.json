Education Internship / (major) project Relevant Coursework Experiences "],["id_02.html", "Free schedule plan Introduction", " Free schedule plan Introduction In about two years, I picture myself completing my master’s program in Medical Science. My goal is to actively participate in an oncology research group, utilizing bioinformatics tools to propel advancements in the field of oncology. Currently, I am making steady progress toward this objective. Drawing on my background in Life Sciences and a growing interest in data science applied to biology, I am well-equipped to make meaningful contributions to oncology research through bioinformatics. To continue on this path, I recognize the importance of seizing educational opportunities, gaining hands-on research experience, and expanding my professional network within the relevant fields. In terms of skill development, I have chosen to explore the Bisulfite sequencing technique (BS-seq) during the “Data Science for Biology 2” course. This decision reflects the pivotal role of BS-seq in epigenomics research, where it is instrumental in uncovering DNA methylation patterns and their implications for gene regulation and disease. By mastering BS-seq techniques, I aim to contribute significantly to the advancement of understanding epigenetic mechanisms and their diverse biological implications. Goals Understanding the Bisulfite conversion technique Exploring new bioinformatic packages and tools Understanding the workflow of the BS-seq Plan I’ll spend 32 hours on my free schedule to begin learning my new skill in BS-seq in across 4 days in two weeks. in the table 1 you will find my planning for the 4 days.

Additionally, it contains 5 NA values. The data type of compConcentration is currently character, which will cause an error when used on the X-axis. We need to convert it to double. The “compConcentration” values are mostly in units of nM, but for the experiments with Ethanol, the units are in percentage (pct). These values need to be converted to nM first. The compName and expType variables are currently stored as character strings. To use them effectively in our plot, we need to convert them into factors. Correction EtOH values To calculate the concentration of “Ethanol” in a solution given as a percentage and convert it to nano molar (nMol/L), follow the steps outlined below.

The number of offspring was counted after incubating nematodes in S-medium for an unspecified period, exposed to different concentrations of naphthalene, 2,6-di-isopropylnaphthalene, decane, and ethanol. The negative control, S-medium, is represented as having a ‘compConcentration’ of 0%, which is barely shown in the graph because the log10 of 0 is undefined. Analysis plan Pseudocode Analysing Compound Concentrations: Load the data (import dataset). Filter the data to separate concentrations by compound (filter concentrations). Create a bar graph representing the concentrations for each compound, with standard deviation bars as error bars (plotting). Conduct a Shapiro-Wilk test separately for each group to assess normality (normality check). Perform an analysis of variance (ANOVA) test to determine if there are significant differences between the compound groups (ANOVA test). If the ANOVA test yields significance, proceed with post hoc tests to compare specific groups (post hoc test). Draw conclusions based on the results obtained (conclusion). Comparing LC50 Curves: Load the LC50 data (import dataset). Filter the data to obtain LC50 concentrations for each compound (filter concentration). Plot the LC50 curves for each compound (plotting). Calculate the 95% confidence intervals for each LC50 curve (95% confidence interval). Assess the overlap between the 95% confidence intervals of different compounds (check overlap). Draw conclusions based on the comparison of LC50 curves and the overlap of confidence intervals (conclusion). Normalising CE_LIQ_FLOW_062_Tidydata We are interested in how the number of nematode offspring changes after incubation with a substance compared to the normal situation. This information cannot be discerned from the above graph because the number of offspring in the negative control is not shown. To address this, I normalize the data by expressing the number of offspring in each measurement as a fraction of the average number of offspring after incubation in S-medium. # filter on &quot;controlNegative&quot; data CE_LIQ_FLOW_062_contNeg &lt;- CE_LIQ_FLOW_062_Tidydata %&gt;% filter(expType == &quot;controlNegative&quot;) # calculate mean of &quot;RawData&quot; of the filtered dataset contNeg_mean &lt;- mean(CE_LIQ_FLOW_062_contNeg$RawData) contNeg_mean # check contNeg_mean ## [1] 85.9 # create a normalised column with the normalised values.

For each exposure to one of the substances at a specific concentration, the fraction of offspring was calculated relative to the number of offspring in the negative control. Conclusion In the positive control group, significantly fewer nematodes were born after incubation in 1.5% ethanol compared to S-medium, as evidenced by a fraction much smaller than 1. At substance concentrations lower than approximately 0.06 nM (or log10 values lower than -1.25), the number of nematodes born was either similar to, less than, or greater than the number born in the negative control group. Thus, at these lower concentrations, there appears to be no noticeable effect on the number of offspring. However, for incubation at higher concentrations of the three tested substances, fewer nematodes were born compared to the negative control, indicating a significant impact on offspring production. "],["id_05.html", "Reproducible Research Open peer review Reproducible analysis", " Reproducible Research Open peer review Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the critical role of open science and reproducible research. Open science facilitates the free exchange of findings, while reproducible research ensures that publications are both accessible and verifiable, thereby enhancing transparency and trust in scientific conclusions. Together, these practices drive scientific progress forward [1]. The transparency criteria of Reproducibility and reporting practices in COVID-19 preprint manuscripts was used to examine the reproducibility of an published article. I’ll peer review Applying Cell Painting in Non-Tumorigenic Breast Cells to Understand Impacts of Common Chemical Exposures from bioRxiv using the transparency criteria shown in table 2. Article overview Researchers used Cell Painting to study the effects of various chemicals on mammary cells to understand their potential links to breast cancer. They examined 16 chemicals and 21 small molecules, analysing over 3000 cellular features. By comparing their findings with human exposure data, they identified similarities between certain chemicals and known pathways. Notably, a pesticide metabolite showed similarities to a Wnt pathway activator, suggesting a potential mechanism for breast cancer risk. This study highlights Cell Painting’s utility in understanding the effects of common environmental toxins on breast cancer[2]. Peer review Table 2. The Ripeta team analyzed eight reproducibility criteria [1]. Transparency Criteria Definition REsponse Type Score Study Purpose A concise statement in the introduction of the article, often in the last paragraph, that establishes the reason the research was conducted. Also called the study objective. Binary yes Data Availability Statement A statement, in an individual section offset from the main body of text, that explains how or if one can access a study’s data. The title of the section may vary, but it must explicitly mention data; it is therefore distinct from a supplementary materials section. Binary yes Data Location Where the article’s data can be accessed, either raw or processed. Found Value yes; all in paper or supplementary fils Study Location Author has stated in the methods section where the study took place or the data’s country/region of origin. Binary; Found Value no Author Review The professionalism of the contact information that the author has provided in the manuscript. Tier 3 Ethics Statement A statement within the manuscript indicating any ethical concerns, including the presence of sensitive data. Binary no Funding Statement A statement within the manuscript indicating whether or not the authors received funding for their research. Binary yes Code Availability Authors have shared access to the most updated code that they used in their study, including code used for analysis. Binary no Conclusion This article meets most criteria at a sufficient level. However, it falls short in a couple of key areas. Firstly, it does not specify the study locations in the methods section. Secondly, there is no code available for the analysis, hindering the replicability of the results. These shortcomings could impact the article’s reception in open peer review processes, highlighting areas for improvement in transparency and reproducibility. Furthermore, there was no ethics statement mentioned. This may not be relevant in this study, but it should be included in the ethical statement section. With these shortcomes, the article does not pass the open peer review. Reproducible analysis From this blog, I chose a open source paper using the OSF website to reproduce a peace of code that is used in the study. From this paper, I have reproduced a piece of code. The associated code and datasets can be found here. The codes in this RMarkdown were used to create the figures presented in this paper. On a scale from 1 (very poor) to 5 (very good), I rate the readability of the codes in this file a 4. Below, I reproduce a portion of the data to recreate figure 1 from the paper. It was easily to reproduce this figure, with a difficulty rating of 5 on a scale from 1 (very difficult) to 5 (very easy). I had to make a few minor adjustments to create the figure due to the updated version of ggplot. Further, the figure that was generated with this code is identical to the one in the paper. # Replication Study 50 # Figure 1 # Relative abundance of Fusobacterium in CRC vs adjacent normal (combined independent replicates) # Samples with detectable Fusobacterium in CRC and adjacent normal # R Version 3.4.2 # Required Packages library(httr) # version 1.2.1 library(rjson) #version 0.2.15 library(plotrix) # version 3.6-6 library(ggplot2) # version 2.2.1 library(cowplot) #version 0.8.0 #source(&quot;~/credentials.R&quot;) #for private use during r script generation #Downloads R script &quot;download.OSF.file.R&quot; GET(&quot;https://osf.io/hkpjb/?action=download&quot;, write_disk(&quot;download.OSF.file.R&quot;, overwrite = TRUE)) ## Response [https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/p7ayb/providers/osfstorage/59a5b71f9ad5a10255d6f93e?action=download&amp;direct&amp;version=7] ## Date: 2024-05-23 15:04 ## Status: 200 ## Content-Type: application/octet-stream ## Size: 3.58 kB ## &lt;ON DISK&gt; /Users/naresh/Documents/08_DSFB/DSFB2_portfolio/download.OSF.file.R source(&quot;download.OSF.file.R&quot;) #calls the download.OSF.file #Downloads data file &#39;Study_50_combined_qPCR_statistical_analysis.R&#39; from https://osf.io/8vcea/ download.OSF.file(GUID=&quot;8vcea&quot;,Access_Token=RPCB_private_access,file_name=&quot;Study_50_combined_qPCR_statistical_analysis.R&quot;) ## [1] &quot;The file has been downloaded to your working directory as: Study_50_combined_qPCR_statistical_analysis.R&quot; source(&quot;Study_50_combined_qPCR_statistical_analysis.R&quot;) ## [1] &quot;The file has been downloaded to your working directory as: Study_50_ddCT_3.17.16.R&quot; ## [1] &quot;The file has been downloaded to your working directory as: Study_50_Ct_Values_3.17.16.csv&quot; ## [1] &quot;The file has been downloaded to your working directory as: Study_50_ddCT_4.25.16.R&quot; ## [1] &quot;The file has been downloaded to your working directory as: Study_50_Ct_Values_4.25.16.csv&quot; # make data.frame of the combined data log_all_total &lt;- data.frame(log_all_3.17$FoldChange, log_all_4.25$FoldChange, log_all_3.17$ID) colnames(log_all_total) &lt;- c(&quot;FoldChange_3.17&quot;, &quot;FoldChange_4.25&quot;, &quot;ID&quot;) # calculate average fold change, sd, and se avg &lt;- NULL stdev&lt;- NULL sder &lt;- NULL for (i in 1:40) { avg[i] &lt;- (log_all_total[i,1]+log_all_total[i,2])/2 stdev[i] &lt;- sd(c(log_all_total[i,1],log_all_total[i,2])) sder[i] &lt;- std.error(c(log_all_total[i,1],log_all_total[i,2])) } # assign column names log_all_total$meanFoldChange &lt;- avg log_all_total$sd &lt;- stdev log_all_total$se &lt;- sder # subset on samples with detectable F. nucleatum in both CRC and adjacent normal tissues (Ct below 35) exp_plot &lt;- log_all_total[which(log_all_total$ID %in% intersect(gsub(&quot;-.*&quot;,&quot;&quot;,adjnorm_Ct_35),gsub(&quot;-.*&quot;,&quot;&quot;,tumor_Ct_35))),] # Draw plot for fold gene expression change (2-ddCt) # Figure 1 Figure1 &lt;- ggplot(exp_plot, aes(x = reorder(ID,meanFoldChange), y = meanFoldChange)) + geom_bar(stat = &quot;identity&quot;, colour = &quot;white&quot;, fill = &quot;black&quot;, width=0.95) + geom_errorbar(position=position_dodge(.9), width=.25, size = 0.75, aes(ymin=meanFoldChange-se, ymax=meanFoldChange+se), color = &quot;grey&quot;) + scale_y_continuous(trans = &quot;log10&quot;, breaks = c(0.1,1,10,100), labels = c(&quot;0.10&quot;,&quot;1.00&quot;,&quot;10.00&quot;,&quot;100.00&quot;), limits = c(0.1,100), expand = c(0,0)) + xlab(&quot;Patients&quot;) + ylab(~ atop(paste(&quot;Fold change in &quot;, italic(&quot;F. nucleatum&quot;), &quot; abundance&quot;), paste(&quot;in CRC vs adjacent normal tissue&quot;))) + scale_x_discrete(labels = c(&quot;1&quot;,&quot;2&quot;,&quot;3&quot;,&quot;4&quot;,&quot;5&quot;,&quot;6&quot;)) + geom_hline(yintercept=1) + theme_bw() + theme(panel.background = element_blank(), panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(), panel.grid.minor = element_blank(), panel.grid.major.y = element_line(linewidth =0.5, color=&quot;grey80&quot;), axis.line.x = element_line(), axis.line.y = element_line(), axis.text.x = element_text(size=15, margin=margin(5,0,0,0), color = &quot;black&quot;), axis.text.y = element_text(size=15, margin=margin(0,5,0,0), color = &quot;black&quot;), axis.title.x = element_text(size=20,margin=margin(20,0,0,0)), axis.title.y = element_text(size=20,angle=90,margin=margin(0,20,0,0)), axis.ticks.length = unit(0.25, &quot;cm&quot;), plot.margin = unit(c(1,.5,1,.5),&quot;cm&quot;)) title &lt;- ggdraw() + draw_label(&quot;Figure 1&quot;, size=20) Figure1 &lt;- plot_grid(title,Figure1, ncol = 1,rel_heights = c(0.1,1)) Figure1 # saves file &#39;Study_50_Figure_1.pdf&#39; locally ggsave(&quot;Study_50_Figure_1.pdf&quot;, dpi=300, height = 6.6 , width = 6) References "],["id_06.html", "R package", " R package I build the R package {SynopsisPackage}.

"],["id_07.html", "Projecticum: Pediatric Cancer Introduction", " Projecticum: Pediatric Cancer Introduction the past decade, we have witnessed a change from traditional invasive techniques for diagnosing and monitoring cancer to more innovative and non-invasive methods, such as liquid biopsies. This new approach has revolutionized the field of clinical oncology, offering significant benefits such as simplified tumour sampling and personalized therapeutic strategies [3]. Liquid biopsies involve the isolation and analysis of tumour-derived samples, such as circulating tumour cells (CTC) and circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA), from the bodily fluids of cancer patients. Once these biomarkers are extracted, they provide invaluable information about tumour characteristics such as progression, staging, heterogeneity, gene mutations, and clonal evolution. Thus, liquid biopsies have improved our understanding of tumours, leading to better detection, ongoing monitoring, and personalized treatment [3]. cfDNA Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is a term used to describe small fragments of DNA that circulate freely in bodily fluids such as blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid. Unlike DNA contained within intact cells, cfDNA is released into the bloodstream through various physiological processes, including apoptosis, necrosis, and active secretion [4]. The origins of cfDNA are diverse and can include contributions from normal cells, as well as cells undergoing pathological processes such as cancer. In the context of liquid biopsy, which involves the analysis of biomarkers in bodily fluids for diagnostic or monitoring purposes, cfDNA holds particular significance [3, 5]. In cancer patients, cfDNA can contain genetic mutations or other alterations that are characteristic of the tumour. These small fragments of DNA are called ctDNA. By isolating and analysing cfDNA from a blood sample, clinicians can gain valuable insights into the genetic profile of a patient’s tumour, potentially facilitating early detection, monitoring of disease progression, assessment of treatment response, and detection of resistance mutations [5]. R shiny app The R shiny app: A place where you can “make an interactive web application that executes R code on the backend”. The functionality and user friendly interactivity of the R shiny is needed for our project for 2 main reasons. When looking at data, you need to be able to visualize it. Then when this data is visualized, you are still able to give user inputs that can adjust and modify the visualization and results that you are looking for [6]. When working with the ct- and cf-DNA, we want to be able to really visualize and capture what this data means for us. But in the mean time we also would like to give inputs for our charts and graphs, that makes it so that we can really pinpoint on the things we are sought after. By having a web application that can run R calculations on the background, we can create an user friendly environment, that can be used by more than just data scientist.
