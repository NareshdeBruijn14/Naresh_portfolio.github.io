<h2>Allow me to introduce myself briefly</h2>
<p class="justify">
I am deeply passionate about learning about cancer and continually seek opportunities to expand my knowledge in this area. I possess strong analytical skills and expertise in R and Bash coding. I have actively engaged in various initiatives related to cancer research. This includes my internship at Hartwig Medical Foundation, as well as projects at Hubrecht Institute, and Princess Maxima Centre. Through these experiences, I have developed a deep understanding of the complexities of cancer and the importance of data‚Äêdriven approaches in advancing our understanding and treatment options.

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p class="justify">
In about two years, I picture myself completing my master‚Äôs program in Medical Science. My goal is to actively participate in an oncology research group, utilizing bioinformatics tools to propel advancements in the field of oncology. Currently, I am making steady progress toward this objective. Drawing on my background in Life Sciences and a growing interest in data science applied to biology, I am well-equipped to make meaningful contributions to oncology research through bioinformatics. To continue on this path, I recognize the importance of seizing educational opportunities, gaining hands-on research experience, and expanding my professional network within the relevant fields.

<p class="justify">
In terms of skill development, I have chosen to explore the Bisulfite sequencing technique (BS-seq) during the ‚ÄúData Science for Biology 2‚Äù course. This decision reflects the pivotal role of BS-seq in epigenomics research, where it is instrumental in uncovering DNA methylation patterns and their implications for gene regulation and disease. By mastering BS-seq techniques, I aim to contribute significantly to the advancement of understanding epigenetic mechanisms and their diverse biological implications.

<div id="goals" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Goals</h3>
<ul class="g">
<li>
Understanding the Bisulfite conversion technique
</li>
<li>
Exploring new bioinformatic packages and tools
</li>
<li>
Understanding the workflow of the BS-seq
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="plan" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Plan</h3>
<p class="justify0">
I‚Äôll spend 32 hours on my free schedule to begin learning my new skill in BS-seq in across 4 days in two weeks. in the table 1 you will find my planning for the 4 days.

<li>
Load the data (import dataset).

<li>
Filter the data to separate concentrations by compound (filter concentrations).

<li>
Create a bar graph representing the concentrations for each compound, with standard deviation bars as error bars (plotting).
</li>

Conduct a Shapiro-Wilk test separately for each group to assess normality (normality check).

<li>
Perform an analysis of variance (ANOVA) test to determine if there are significant differences between the compound groups (ANOVA test).

If the ANOVA test yields significance, proceed with post hoc tests to compare specific groups (post hoc test).

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p class="justify">
The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the critical role of open science and reproducible research. Open science facilitates the free exchange of findings, while reproducible research ensures that publications are both accessible and verifiable, thereby enhancing transparency and trust in scientific conclusions. Together, these practices drive scientific progress forward <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-sumnerReproducibilityReportingPractices2020">1</a>]</span>.

<h3>Article overview</h3>
<p class="justify">
Researchers used Cell Painting to study the effects of various chemicals on mammary cells to understand their potential links to breast cancer. They examined 16 chemicals and 21 small molecules, analysing over 3000 cellular features. By comparing their findings with human exposure data, they identified similarities between certain chemicals and known pathways. Notably, a pesticide metabolite showed similarities to a Wnt pathway activator, suggesting a potential mechanism for breast cancer risk. This study highlights Cell Painting‚Äôs utility in understanding the effects of common environmental toxins on breast cancer<span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-tapaswiApplyingCellPainting2024">2</a>]</span>.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p class="justify">
This article meets most criteria at a sufficient level. However, it falls short in a couple of key areas. Firstly, it does not specify the study locations in the methods section. Secondly, there is no code available for the analysis, hindering the replicability of the results. These shortcomings could impact the article‚Äôs reception in open peer review processes, highlighting areas for improvement in transparency and reproducibility. Furthermore, there was no ethics statement mentioned. This may not be relevant in this study, but it should be included in the ethical statement section. With these shortcomes, the article does not pass the open peer review.

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p class="justify">
the past decade, we have witnessed a change from traditional invasive techniques for diagnosing and monitoring cancer to more innovative and non-invasive methods, such as liquid biopsies. This new approach has revolutionized the field of clinical oncology, offering significant benefits such as simplified tumor sampling and personalized therapeutic strategies <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-nikanjamLiquidBiopsyCurrent2022">3</a>]</span>.
</p>
<p class="justify">
Liquid biopsies involve the isolation and analysis of tumor-derived samples, such as circulating tumor cells (CTC) and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), from the bodily fluids of cancer patients. Once these biomarkers are extracted, they provide invaluable information about tumor characteristics such as progression, staging, heterogeneity, gene mutations, and clonal evolution. Thus, liquid biopsies have improved our understanding of tumors, leading to better detection, ongoing monitoring, and personalized treatment <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-nikanjamLiquidBiopsyCurrent2022">3</a>]</span>.

<h3>cfDNA</h3>
<p class="justify">
Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is a term used to describe small fragments of DNA that circulate freely in bodily fluids such as blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid. Unlike DNA contained within intact cells, cfDNA is released into the bloodstream through various physiological processes, including apoptosis, necrosis, and active secretion <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-bronkhorstCharacterizationCellfreeDNA2016">4</a>]</span>. The origins of cfDNA are diverse and can include contributions from normal cells, as well as cells undergoing pathological processes such as cancer. In the context of liquid biopsy, which involves the analysis of biomarkers in bodily fluids for diagnostic or monitoring purposes, cfDNA holds particular significance <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-nikanjamLiquidBiopsyCurrent2022">3</a>, <a href="#ref-dangCirculatingTumorDNA">5</a>]</span>.
</p>
<p class="justify">
In cancer patients, cfDNA can contain genetic mutations or other alterations that are characteristic of the tumor. These small fragments of DNA are called ctDNA. By isolating and analyzing cfDNA from a blood sample, clinicians can gain valuable insights into the genetic profile of a patient‚Äôs tumor, potentially facilitating early detection, monitoring of disease progression, assessment of treatment response, and detection of resistance mutations <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-dangCirculatingTumorDNA">5</a>]</span>.

<h3>R shiny app</h3>
<p class="justify">
The R shiny app: A place where you can ‚Äúmake an interactive web application that executes R code on the backend‚Äù. The functionality and user friendly interactivity of the R shiny is needed for our project for 2 main reasons. When looking at data, you need to be able to visualize it. Then when this data is visualized, you are still able to give user inputs that can adjust and modify the visualization and results that you are looking for <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-WhatShinyDomino">6</a>]</span>.
</p>
<p class="justify">
When working with the ct- and cf-DNA, we want to be able to really visualize and capture what this data means for us. But in the mean time we also would like to give inputs for our charts and graphs, that makes it so that we can really pinpoint on the things we are sought after. By having a web application that can run R calculations on the background, we can create an user friendly environment, that can be used by more than just data scientist.
